// Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health on weight.
// It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms
// and dividing by the square of your height in meters. Write a dart code that
// prompts the user to enter a weight in pounds and height in inches and display
// the BMI.
// Note: 1 pound = .45359237 kg and 1 inch = 0.254 meters
